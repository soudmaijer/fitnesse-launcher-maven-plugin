FitNesse Launcher Plugin

  This Maven Plugin directly launches FitNesse integration test server.
  
* Why do we need yet another Maven plugin for FitNesse?

  We already have a number of Maven plugins for FitNesse,
  including {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/fitnesse-maven-plugin/}<<<fitnesse-maven-plugin>>>}},
  {{{http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.RunningFromMaven}<<<maven-trinidad-plugin>>>}} and others.
  
  The author of FitNesse Launcher Plugin found these plugins
  difficult or awkward to configure in an environment agnostic fashion suitable for team development.
  In particular, the design of FitNesse is that it {{{http://gojko.net/FitNesse/book/ch10.html}runs as a server}},
  and therefore is intended to be installed as a single instance and accessed via HTTP, rather than embedded in project source.
  In contrast to this, it is often desirable that integration tests are stored with their respective project source,
  rather than in a central test location or repository.
  
  As a result projects will often commit the entire set of FitNesse server files to SCM,
  and / or write custom bootstrap code (typically a <<<main(String [] args)>>> method).
  The {{{http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.ClassPath}java classpath for FitNesse}} is particularly {{{http://johannesbrodwall.com/2008/03/19/some-fitnesse-tricks-classpath-and-debugging/}difficult to configure}},
  but vital to get correct, as FitNesse boots a fresh JVM in which to run tests.
  
  A particularly inspired idea is to use a Maven plugin which makes Maven Dependencies available to FitNesse as the configured classpath.
  This has the advantages of:
  
    *
    
      only needing project dependencies to be configured in a single location: the <<<pom.xml>>>
    
    *
    
      allowing those dependencies to be configured in an environment agnostic way.
    
  Two plugins exist which do this: {{{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mvn-fit-cpgen/}<<<maven-fitnesse-cpgen-plugin>>>}}
  and {{{https://github.com/lvonk/fitnesse-maven-classpath}<<<fitnesse-maven-classpath>>>}}.
  The author of FitNesse Launcher Plugin was happily using <<<fitnesse-maven-classpath>>> with {{{http://xebia.github.com/Xebium/}Xebium}}
  (a {{{http://fitnesse.org/}FitNesse}} / {{{http://seleniumhq.org/}Selenium}} bridge)
  for a webapp project, when running into the final frustration: <<the dependencies required for Xebium clashed with the dependencies required for the webapp!>>
     
  FitNesse Launcher Plugin aims to solve all of these problems and make it easy to:
  
    *
    
      Configure FitNesse for use in an environment agnostic way, using Maven properties and dependencies.
    
    *
    
      Write FitNesse tests using FitNesse as a wiki, and have the tests located with the project source, with minimal clutter from other FitNesse server files.
    
    *

      Run those same FitNesse tests automatically during Maven's <<<integration-test>>> phase, with results in JUnit XML format and HTML reports available.

* Goals Overview

  General information about the goals.

  * {{{./help-mojo.html}fitnesse:help}} Display help information on <<<fitnesse-launcher-maven-plugin>>>.
  
  * {{{./set-up-mojo.html}fitnesse:set-up}} Fetches and unpacks FitNesse into a correct working directory structure, and makes sure everything is cleanly setup for running FitNesse. Bound to the '<<<pre-integration-test>>>' phase.
  
  * {{{./run-tests-mojo.html}fitnesse:run-tests}} Goal that runs FitNesse tests using fitnesse.junit.TestHelper. Bound to the '<<<integration-test>>>' phase.
  
  * {{{./tear-down-mojo.html}fitnesse:tear-down}} Cleans up debris after FitNesse runs. Bound to the '<<<post-integration-test>>>' phase.
  
  * {{{./verify-mojo.html}fitnesse:verify}} Provides summary report on FitNesse tests run with 'run-tests' goal. Will fail the build if there are test failures. Bound to the '<<<verify>>>' phase.
  
  * {{{./wiki-mojo.html}fitnesse:wiki}} Launches FitNesse as a wiki server. Useful for manually running / developing / debugging FitNesse tests.
  
  * {{{./shutdown-mojo.html}fitnesse:shutdown}} Shuts down FitNesse. This is done by sending GET to <<<http://localhost:<port>/?responder=shutdown>>>.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Plugin Name can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://code.google.com/p/fitnesse-launcher-maven-plugin/w/list}plugin's wiki pages}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
